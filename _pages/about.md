> Open tech isn’t just about code. It’s about choice, creativity, and control.

> <cite>– Matija</cite>

Hi, I’m Matija. a digital explorer and passionate advocate for open tech, digital freedom, and innovation.

I’ve always been curious about how technology works — not just on the surface, but deep under the hood. Over time, that curiosity grew into a belief: that tech should be transparent, open, and in the hands of its users. That belief is what led me to create OpenTech Pulse.

This blog is my personal space to document what I learn — from configuring Linux servers and testing out self-hosted tools, to experimenting with open hardware like ESP32 and reviewing software that respects user choice. It's part knowledge base, part lab notebook, and part manifesto for a freer, more user-driven tech world.

I write for fellow builders, tinkerers, developers, and curious minds — anyone who values understanding and owning the tools they use. Whether you're deep into FOSS, just getting started with self-hosting, or simply like to know how things work, you’re in the right place.

Thanks for being here. Let’s keep pushing the boundaries of what open tech can do — together.
