For me it was time to buy a new laptop. I wanted a Laptop that is 100% Linux compatible.

You might wonder: Aren't all laptops and desktops Linux compatible? Yes and no. Many of us have experienced the hassle of finding drivers for devices that, ultimately, do not work perfectly.

So I went to do the search game and rather fast found a company that builds Linux laptops and computers that are 100% compatible with Linux.

This company is called <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com" target="_blank">TUXEDO Computers</a>. This is a company located in Germany and you can configure your laptop or desktop with the specs you like.

I went for the <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Pro-14-Gen8.tuxedo" target="_blank">TUXEDO InfinityBook Pro 14" - Gen8 (Black casing)</a> with the following specs:

- CPU: Intel Core i7-13700H (14 Core / 20 Threads)
- VGA: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 6GB Refresh
- Screen: Omnia Display 3k 14" (2880 x 1800) 16:10 90Hz LTPS TFT-LCD, matte / non-glare
- Memory: 64 GB (2x 32GB) DDR5 4800MHz Crucial
- Storage: 1 TB Samsung 990 PRO (NVMe PCIe 4.0)
- Keyboard: Keyboard with TUX super-key
- Wifi / Bluetooth: Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX211 (802.11ax 2.4, 5 & 6 GHz & Bluetooth 5.3)

The reason why I wanted a 14" is that i wanted it be very mobile so i can take it everywhere i go.

So let's begin...

## First impression

I was instantly in love with this machine. It looks good and feels really firm and premium. It's sleek, modern and thin.
What I also love about this laptop is the huge track pad and the keyboard. The keyboard has a really nice feel and it types really good. The touch of the keys are amazing.

Additionally, the laptop has a nice weight of 1.3 kg. You can easily open the screen without the feeling the laptop is going to move.
The size (Length: 308.8 mm; Width: 215 mm; Height: 16,6 mm) are ideal for mobility so you can basically fit it in any backpack!

There is absolutely nothing I dislike about this laptop.

## The Screen

The screen on this laptop is truly magnificent, boasting an Omni Display 3K 14" LTPS TFT-LCD that combines a 16:10 aspect ratio with a 90Hz refresh rate for smooth, crisp visuals. With a maximum resolution of 2880x1800, the display brings unparalleled clarity and depth to every image. Additionally, its matte/non-glare finish significantly reduces reflections from light and sunlight, ensuring optimal viewing comfort under various lighting conditions.

It truly is a pleasure for the eyes, with the very small bezels completing the exquisite visual experience.

## Performance

Performance-wise, this laptop is a real beast! With my configuration, this laptop runs as a train, handling multitasking and demanding applications with unparalleled ease. Its swift responsiveness and smooth operation make it an ideal choice for both professional workloads and gaming. The advanced cooling system ensures it maintains peak performance without overheating, even during extended use. Truly, it's not just about speed; it's about delivering a consistently reliable and powerful computing experience that exceeds expectations at every turn.

When opting for a different operating system, such as Linux Mint (What i am running), instead of the default TUXEDO OS, installing the 'TUXEDO Control Center' becomes indispensable. This powerful application is the key to unlocking the full potential of your device, providing you with comprehensive control over hardware settings and system performance. It allows for precise adjustments to power management, fan control, and system monitoring, ensuring that your laptop operates efficiently under any OS. The seamless integration and intuitive interface of the TUXEDO Control Center make it a must-have tool for optimizing your computing experience and maintaining the optimal balance between performance and energy consumption.
